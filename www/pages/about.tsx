        Cosyll is a platform for educators to publish and
        browse syllabi.
      </h1>
      <p>
        This project aims at providing infrastructure for open-access of syllabi and curricula; it is a place where we can meaningfully search, archive, distribute and reference syllabi.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cosyll is first and foremost for educators, by educators. Whether to have a convenient place to publish your classes, to see how a similar class is being taught at another university, in another country, or to find inspiration in your peers&apos; works, Cosyll focuses on exchange between teachers. In this spirit, we encourage the sharing of documents one does not always easily find online: schedules, assignments descriptions, works cited and referenced, class wikis, etc.
