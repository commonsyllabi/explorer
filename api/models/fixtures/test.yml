      description: "Nach einem Semester im unbewohnten Berliner Umland kehren wir zurück in die Stadt. Eine Stadt, in der uns vieles bekannt und selbstverständlich vorkommt. Mit dem Beginn des Architekturstudiums verändert sich die Sichtweise auf unser gewohntes Umfeld grundlegend.\nDas Beobachten, Analysieren und Hinterfragen von städtischen Phänomenen, Strukturen, Ordnungen und Systemen führt uns zu einem neuen Verständnis von geplantem städtischem Raum und wir entwickeln eine Sensibilität für die Schönheit des vermeintlich Belanglosen.\nWir brechen mit Gewohntem, hinterfragen und suchen nach unbeschrittenen Wegen. Wir halten den Blick offen für Neues und schaffen Raum für neue Ideen. Im Spannungsfeld zwischen der Kraft des Gewohnten und der Dynamik des Experimentellen."

      description: "Das Seminar untersucht historische und zeitgenössische Zeichenmaschinen für Architektur. Der Schwerpunkt liegt auf Perspektographen. Sowohl die Maschinen als auch die Verfahren der Darstellenden Geometrie werden im Seminar aus technischer und aus historischer Sicht untersucht. Historische Quellen werden genutzt, um die Geschichte der Maschinen und ihre Funktionsweise zu verstehen. Anschließend werden in der Programmierumgebung Processing die Maschinen digital nachgebildet und dann mit Arduino hergestellt und gesteuert. Ziel des Seminars ist es, die wichtigsten Zeichenwerkzeuge, die den Architekten im Laufe der Zeit gedient haben, zu erforschen und den Stellenwert analoger und digitaler Zeichengesten im architektonischen Entwurf zu diskutieren."

      description: " This course is an introduction to the theory and practice of digital media, of how they affect the formation of human groups, and how are themselves affected by human groups.\nChanges in means of communication imply changes in the nature of communication itself, and therefore in the nature of the societies which communicate through these means. The near-ubiquitous presence of computer-mediated communications thus affects the way that humans organize, relate and imagine. As computers are changing us, this class provides the tools to approach and understand the nature of these changes. "

The coursework focuses on developing a vocabulary of interaction design principles which can then be applied across a range of platforms. Students are encouraged to experiment with various media, tools, and techniques, ultimately producing a portfolio of interactive and visual projects designed for the screen. An emphasis is placed on typography as it applies to a screen context, research-based problem solving and a “learning through making” approach to technical skill building. Historical and current interaction design precedents will be discussed."

      description: "Wall labels, audio guides, and informative maps are just some of the ways by which galleries and museums convey information and hidden narratives about a collection. Given the changing role of museums and galleries in the 21st century, how can we utilize new tools such as Augmented Reality (AR) to design and deliver immersive experiences that breathe new life into an exhibit? How can such tools do so without distracting from the power and importance of a collection, or by purposefully challenging problematic aspects such as an exhibit’s disputed provenance or ethical concerns? And how can these tools make collections more accessible to a wider audience?\nThis course mobilizes resources from museography, art history, sociology, interaction design and 3D, real-time development to answer these questions. Topics covered include exhibition installation and curation, mixed reality production in Unity, and mobile development for Augmented Reality. The course is open to students from a variety of academic backgrounds interested in gaining hands-on experience in applying new technologies to exhibition spaces."

How designers are coping with new emerging standards? How do we deal with a brand when a Favicon or screen buttons become more important than header paper? We will see how some of the most successful logos only seem to be set in stone, while in reality they constantly mutate and adapt. We also examine how and why certain logos in the last two decades have become metaphors for the worst outcomes of corporate cultures and the targets of anti- globalization activists everywhere. We investigate how and why in our  Age of Brands, logos ended in the spotlight for reasons opposite to the ones they were created for"

      description: "Fact may or may not be stranger than fiction, but invariably both exert strong influences in creating narrative. The course explores how documentary and fiction are combined throughout the history of film and in different cultures. We will examine the work of dozen filmmakers who have merged both formats creating singular hybrid films. Dramatic reconstructions, manipulated imagery or fictional interstitials are frequently incorporated into documentaries to elevate realism. Conversely, fiction occasionally crosses over into documentary to create a sense of authenticity or truthfulness. Lastly, the division is sometimes completely eradicated making it difficult to distinguish the reality from the imaginary. Over the course of the  emester, students will create their own docu-fiction short films. They will bring together fiction and non-fiction story elements reflecting on how each form complements the other."

      description: "This seminar aims to, on the one hand, introduce students to the main theoretical and epistemological trends in the study of the Arab Crossroads region, and on the other, to offer practical examples of the types of methodologies used by scholars working in the humanities and the qualitative social sciences.  The course begins with a critical engagement with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region that is of such global economic and political importance. It then turns to specific areas of research that have attracted considerable attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields.  The course assignments include response papers, short essays on specific debates in relevant scholarship, transcribed interviews, and culminate in an extended research proposal for a capstone project."

      status: "listed"
      description: "Law in Entrepreneurship seeks to prepare students for the interconnectedness of global startup organizations and the internal and external legal environments. The course will provide an introduction to entrepreneurial strategy, focusing on law as a basic framework. The course will provide students with the fundamental and practical knowledge of legal competitiveness for enterprises and will introduce students to a broad range of legal issues encountered by founders and business executives and will also help students develop a set of analytical perspectives for making judgments when such issues arise.\nStudents will act in the roles of key decision-makers or their advisors and solve problems related to the development of the competitive advantage of the enterprise in a given market. While the chief concern of those who create and manage businesses of any kind is often in the mechanics of the business itself, law is an integral part of running the machine that is an enterprise. It is law that sets certain standards for the setting in which a business operates and provides the framework to codify the business’ own standards. Thus, insight into the law becomes a significant tool in the business leader’s repertoire. It allows you to be mindful of the business’ limits and knowledgeable about in what manner the business can be strengthened."

      title: "Sensors, Body and Motion"
      status: "listed"
      description: "Art can be defined as a coalescing of skills and imagination into creative expression. We often experience the results of this process through our senses and then reflect on the presented work. However, through the use of readily accessible open source technologies, such as sensors and computer vision, it is possible to create interactive art that leverages the full potential of the human body and continuously integrates a person into the artistic expression of the work. Directly injecting people-sensing into an art work creates a unique feedback loop, or dialogue-like relationship, where a person does something and a computer senses what the person did and reacts; the person experiences this reaction through their senses and then reacts themselves, and so on and so forth.\nThis course will examine this feedback loop of sensing people and stimulating people's senses, all within the framework of artistic expression. Students will create interactive installations and performances where the human body is the central component of the art work. Since the human body is naturally dynamic and unpredictable, students will be challenged to develop algorithms that manage potentially chaotic data as well as design systems that help guide people’s physical interactions and input. Students will study past and present works in the field to help inform and direct their own creative decisions. "

      status: "listed"
      description: "As the World Wide Web continues to grow and permeate our everyday lives, an ever-increasing amount of data and digital services are accessible to us through public web APIs - Application Programming Interfaces. Common to many web sites, including YouTube, Twitter, Google Maps, Wikipedia and more, web APIs offer a means to programmatically request and re-purpose endless troves of information. But how exactly do we access these datasets and services? How can we write code to transfer, store, and display this content on our own web sites? And how might we use these available resources to design unique, creative, and compelling web experiences of our own.\n\nThis class is about creating interactive single-page web applications that leverage public data and digital services from a wide range of existing web products. The overall goal of the class will be for each student to have 3 well-designed functional single-page web applications by end of semester. Subscribing to a project-oriented approach, a majority of class time will be spent reviewing and writing code, primarily Javascript, for client-side (front-end) web development. We will use a number of Javascript libraries, including jQuery, Underscore, D3,p5, Three and more, to help build a diversity of web experiences. Where server-side (back-end) development is required, we will use the Node-Express framework. Students should have some programming experience as well as an exposure to basic client-side web development, specifically HTML and CSS. Experience with Javascript is a plus."

      status: "listed"
      description: "Painting goes back over 40,000 years, as evidenced by the El Castillo Caves of Spain. No other art form has an accessible history this extensive, which is why the choice to make paintings is particularly challenging. And yet, this is also the reason we continue to do it.  Because, when you reach out with that brush, you are metaphorically touching all painting and thus attempting to communicate with all humanity past and present. Painting has provided us an impression of people from the Neanderthal to the Renaissance to Modern and Post-Modern times. This history serves as evidence of our humanity. Because of its plasticity, painting continues to be the most economic means for expression. The intelligence of painting comes from its 2-dimensional character. It requires the invention of flat abstract shapes to communicate complex, multi-dimensional ideas. For the individual painter the painting process takes place in time. It is an intimate theater of action. However, in public, paintings are experienced in their simultaneity. The paradox; painting is a process that takes place in time but is experienced without time. When we connect with a painting our empathy with the artist collapses all of time into the present. There is no history."

      description: "Unmasking the Actor is a theatre performance course that provides students with a series of tools to allow them not to “play themselves” but to “play using themselves”.\nThe course is based on the performance philosophy and practice of Jacques Lecoq, where an investigation of the mechanics of the body is applied to dramatic creation using different acting traditions. Students analyze their body and movement with four different kinds of mask: Neutral mask, Larval mask, Commedia dell’Arte mask and the smallest mask in the world, the red nose of the clown. In this process, the disguise drives the students to discover emotions, movements and thoughts far from their habitual and comfortable modes of performance; by gradually removing the disguise, they reach self-awareness and learn how to enjoy their presence on stage. Combining the methodologies of Jacques Lecoq, Carlo Boso and Philippe Gaulier the course is a careful study of stage performance and its effects."

      assignments:
        - "Participation (15%)\nParticipation means being present and proactive in the class. Students will be asked to lead acting exercises without prior warning. In working with the mask, students will be encouraged to practice and improvise without fear, and to question themselves. Participation also means letting yourself go in the play space, being mindful but carefree."
        - "Attentive listenting and involvement (25%)\nMost of the exercises require the attention of the spectator. The silent participation of students who are temporarily out of the work space can enrich a performance exercise. In group work, students will be asked to concentrate and remain present, and ready to collaborate. Distraction and carelessness can weaken a performance. Attentive listening and learning to give and receive constructive criticism are crucial traits of this class."
        - "Preparation (30%)\nStudents are expected to conduct research outside of class in order to generate original individual improvisation and creations. Their work must provide evidence that ample time was devoted to research and study, and applied to the practical exercises that will build their final projects.\nAt the end of each mask analysis - four in total - students are required to send an email to the instructor, reflecting upon class  experiences and participation in the work. At the end of Larval, Commedia and Clown sessions, students are expected to create a short scene/improvisation. This may take the form of a 3 to 5 minute original scene inspired by in-class improvisations."
        - "Progress (30%)\nOne third of the final grade is based on the student’s ability to understand and process new stimuli, ideas and working methods, and to progressively incorporate them in his/her practice as an actor. The ability to question their beliefs, not to remain anchored in previous habits and conventions, either physical and emotional, is taken into consideration here."

      status: "listed"
      description: "Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms affect many aspects of our lives whether we realize it or not: banking transactions, healthcare treatments and diagnoses, entertainment recommendations, smart car functionality, customer service agents, financial trading… the list goes on and on. The power of these algorithms lies in their ability to leverage computers to \"study\" and \"learn\". Instead of programming a computer to do a specific task, we program the computer to train itself how to do any number of tasks. As artists, how can we harness the power of these algorithms and apply them towards creative endeavors? This class will explore that basic question. Through a combination of high level applied machine learning techniques, speculative design of artificial intelligence, and some basic understanding of how these algorithms work at a low level, students will explore this rich new field. With their machine counterparts, they will create images, sounds, text, intuitive interactions, chatbots, and more."

      status: "listed"
      description: "An advanced seminar that involves the careful study of some particular movement, philosopher, or issue in the history of philosophy. Examples: Aristotle, Ibn Sina, Kant, German Idealism, theories of causation in Indian philosophy, vice in the global history of philosophy.\nThe topic of this seminar is the philosophy of David Hume [1711- 1776], often considered to be the greatest philosopher to have written in English. Specific sub- topics for examination and discussion include Hume’s treatments of mental representation, space and time, inductive reasoning, belief, probability, causation, knowledge of the external world, epistemic normativity, free will, motivation, moral epistemology, moral normativity, natural virtues, justice, politics, and economics. Recurring themes will include the nature and consequences of his empiricism, skepticism, and naturalism and the systematic interrelations among the various elements of his philosophy. Emphasis will be placed throughout on Hume's significance for issues in contemporary philosophy."
